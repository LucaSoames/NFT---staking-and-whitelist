# NFT---staking-and-whitelist
Staking and whitelist smart contract

The ERC20 token is defined through the IERC20 interface and is used as the staking currency for minting NFTs. The MyNFT contract implements the INFT interface for NFTs.

The contract has a mapping to keep track of NFT ownership, and another mapping for tracking approved transfers of NFTs. The contract also has a mapping for keeping track of which addresses are whitelisted to mint NFTs.

The mint function allows whitelisted addresses to mint NFTs by staking a certain amount of the ERC20 token. If the caller is not whitelisted, or does not have enough staked tokens, the function will revert. The burn function allows the owner of an NFT to burn (or destroy) the NFT, which removes it from circulation.

The stake and unstake functions allow addresses to stake and unstake tokens, respectively. When an address stakes tokens, it becomes whitelisted and is able to mint NFTs. When an address unstakes tokens, it loses its whitelisted status and receives back the staking reward.

The approve function allows the owner of an NFT to give approval for another address to transfer the NFT. The getApproved function returns the address that has been approved to transfer the NFT. The transferFrom function allows an approved address to transfer the NFT from the current owner to a new owner.

The contract also emits events for the Approval and Transfer functions to allow external applications to track NFT ownership and transfer activity.

Overall, this contract provides a basic implementation of an ERC20 NFT with staking and whitelisting functionality. It can be customized and extended to fit specific use cases and business requirements.
